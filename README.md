# Internal Restlessness Scale (IRS) Calculator

This is a TypeScript implementation of the Internal Restlessness Scale (IRS) developed by Dr. Lisa Weyandt. The scale is designed to measure inner restlessness, which is often associated with ADHD symptoms.

## About the IRS

### Score Interpretation

- **24-69**: Typical range for neurotypical adults
- **70-89**: Borderline range, may indicate subclinical symptoms
- **90-110**: Typical range for adults with ADHD
- **110-168**: High range, often seen in significant ADHD symptoms
